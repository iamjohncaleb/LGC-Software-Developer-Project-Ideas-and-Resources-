### How to Contribute ✔️

If you're interested in contributing, start by browsing the issues and pull requests to check if someone has already proposed a similar idea or question.

If your idea isn't listed and aligns with the goals of this guide, follow these steps:
- For minor contributions, such as fixing typos, feel free to open a pull request directly.
- For significant contributions, like adding a new guide, start by creating an issue. This allows others to share their thoughts before you begin working on it.
